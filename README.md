# COSC445-Coding-Project
# Overview
In addition to lab assignments, you will also work on a project of building a computer vision system. The aim is to use what you learned in the course in building a working Computer Vision system.

Students will work on the project in teams of 5 students (could also be 4 but you need to justify why). It is expected that you should spend around 8 to 10 hours each (i.e. 40 to 50 hours total for all group members). This time can either be spent together or individually. You may work on the project during the labs after the regular lab is completed, but it is expected that most of the time spent will be outside of regular lab and lecture time.

Note the following:

You can use the Matlab Image Processing Toolbox or similar image processing tools when implementing your project. However, you will need to implement the Computer Vision algorithms yourself. This means you CANNOT use the Matalab Computer Vision System Toolbox or similar ready-made tools.
The only exception to the above rule is for SIFT and HOG algorithms where you can use the library described in the lecture notes.
It is strongly recommended to test your final system on "video" files rather than still images. If it makes more sense to test your code on a still image, you will need to justify this. Applying your algorithm on a video file should produce the same output as if it is applied to a still image. With a video file, we will be able to see the effect of small changes in the video frames on your algorithm.
Try to achieve the highest accuracy you can get with your algorithm. However, I don't expect to see a 100% accurate results from your project (would be great if you can do 100% though :-).
Timeline
The project is out of 100 marks and is worth 15% of your final grade. The project has three deadlines: team formation (0 marks), project proposal (0 marks) and final report and demonstration (presentation) (100 marks)

# February 6: Team Formation
Marking: worth 0 marks.
Deliverables: Each team must select one member as the group representative. The group rep must submit on Canvas the names and e-mail addresses of all his/her group members. Other members don't need to submit anything for this project component. As mentioned above, each group should include 5 students.
Note that the same group will be working on both the "Project" as well as the "Selected Topic Presentation".
February 27: Project Proposal
Marking: worth 0 marks.
Deliverables: The group rep of each group should submit a proposal of a max of 3 pages, double spaced, describing what his/her team is going to build. 
Your proposal must cover the following:
Overview: Describe the basic idea and goal of your project and how it is related to the real world application.
Scope: Give brief description of what the scope of your project is and what exactly you will implement.
Input: What is the input for your system? For example, still images, a sequence of images, a prerecorded or live video stream.
Output: what is the output of your system?
Software/Hardware requirements: For example, the system will be implemented on Matlab and will use a webcam.
March 28: Submit Project Presentation
Marking: worth 0 marks.
Deliverables: The group rep should submit to Canvas the presentation slides that you will use to demonstrate your project. The slides can be in any format (e.g. PowerPoint, PDF, Prezi, etc).
March 29 - April 3: Project Presentation
Marking: worth 100 marks.
Deliverables: Each group will do an in-class presentation of approximately 10 minutes showing their system. The presentation slides should have been submitted to Canvas before the presentation day (see deadline above). In addition, you also need to submit to Canvas the following before the end of April 3:
Your source code.
A video file showing your system in action.
A report of up to 10 page (double spaced) description of your overall system.
Both report documentation and presentation slides should include the topics listed below (next section).
The Project Report
Here is a list of topics that need to be covered in details in the report:

# Project title
Abstract (1-2 paragraph summary of the project)
Introduction and background description.
Problem statement
Related work (previous algorithms and applications related to the problem under investigation and to your solution)
Proposed solution (your solution)
Experimental results
Discussion of the results (e.g. limitations, weaknesses, strengths, etc)
Conclusion and future work
References: List of technical papers cited in the text (if any).
You can use the same outline/structure for both the report documentation and the in-class presentation of your project. Of course the presentation will involve less details and will be shorter due to its nature (for example, you don't have to have an "Abstract" for your presentation).

# Guidelines for the Project's Presentation
You have a total for 10 minutes for presenting your project in class! Try to finish in 8 minutes and leave 2 minutes for questions.
Focus on the important, interesting, and challenging parts of your project.
Remember that your audience is COSC 445 students and instructor. Skip the parts that we already know and focus on those aspects that we are not familiar with so that we can easily follow your presentation.
You will use a projector for showing us your work. All file formats that involves showing 'slides' are OK (PPT, PDF, Prezi, etc).
Include a video of your system in action as part of the "Experimental results" of your presentation.
Project Ideas
Here are some ideas for the course project. This list is not inclusive, meaning that you may propose other ideas if you wish.

Gesture controlled applications (e.g. control Windows Explorer, web browsers, etc using hand, head, eye, etc gestures).
Gesture controlled interfaces (e.g. hand gesture to hardware devices such as smart appliances, robots, electronic thermometers, etc).
Determine the time from an analog clock.
Identification of musical notes as played by a musician (e.g. on a Piano, Guitar, etc).
Pool simulation system for predicting best shots.
Object classification in areal images (e.g. Google map images).
Counting cars in a video stream (you must consider different environmental conditions)
Tracking finger moves (to drawing on MS Paint, to read sign-language and help deaf people, etc)
Zip-code recognition on parcels/mails
License plate recognition (recognize the numbers on a license plate of which photo with a hand-held camera)
Tennis ball tracking (track the ball and compute score, determine if ball is inside or outside, etc)
Road sign recognition (e.g. show warning when specific signs are detected: "Stop", "Yield", "school zone", etc)
Detect deficiencies on a product line (e.g. incorrect soldering on printed circuit board, defected products, etc)
Circuit Diagram Simulation (check if simple electric circuit will function correctly based on a give design)
Assisted parking (for a car trying to park in a parking spot, compute distances using a top-view video stream and issue warning and directions)
Automatic sorter (using a top-view camera, classify objects on a belt to guide them to their correct category)

Bonus marks will be awarded to the top 4 projects with the best receiving +10, second best +7.5, the third +5, and the fourth +2.5.
Submission to Canvas (0 marks)
There are no further marks assigned for the act of submitting the project deliverables to Canvas. However,

Marks will be deducted for not submitting each deliverable item above (some items such as the Report may receive a zero if not submitted).
Late-submission policy from the syllabus will applied to the items that are submitted after the indicated deadline.
Note that the above mark breakdown applies only to working systems. If a non-working system is provided, part marks or zero may be awarded to every item above.
