Functions needed:

Find image axes: 
	inputs image of a clock - IClock
	outputs IClock, array of 4 coordinates for numbers
	Find 12, 3, 6, 9
		inputs IClock and image of number to be found
		outputs coordinate of number
Find clock center
	inputs IClock, 4 points of numbers
	outputs a skewed image - ISkew, coordinates of the clock centre
//Convert image to polar coord
//Scale Mark Detection Based on the Improved Central Projection Method
Un-Canny
	inputs: ISkew, sigma
	outputs: image of edges IEdge
Hough Transform-Based Pointer Detection
	inputs: IEdge, 
	outputs: The answer to everything apparently
