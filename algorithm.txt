Functions needed:

Find image axes: 
	inputs image of a clock - IClock
	outputs IClock, array of 4 coordinates for numbers, and 4 images of the selected numbers
	Find 12, 3, 6, 9
		inputs IClock and image of number to be found
		outputs coordinate of number
Find clock center
	inputs IClock, 4 points of numbers
	outputs a skewed image - ISkew, coordinates of the clock centre
//Convert image to polar coord
//Scale Mark Detection Based on the Improved Central Projection Method
Un-Canny
	inputs: ISkew, sigma
	outputs: image of edges IEdge
Hough Transform-Based Pointer Detection
	inputs: IEdge, 
	outputs: The answer to everything apparently
The Pointer Gauge Indicating Value Recognition


Questions for brother Dallah:
1. Did the due date change?
2. Can we use hough(), houghpeaks(), houghlines()?
3. Do we have to be able to track a video of the clock from different angles, distances, etc. or
can we assume the camera will be steady?
4. Do we need to process the times in real time (reading time takes less than one second).
